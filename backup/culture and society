Education, culture, and society 

Many countries in today's society regard education as the country's top priority, especially in Western countries. As a national cause, education is like the wheels of society, playing an irreplaceable role. And social culture is the natural formation of a nation and country in the long-term historical development. This thesis will focus on the basic understanding of education and social culture, and the relationship between education and social culture.

Humanity could understand education in the narrow or the broad sense. In the broad sense, education refers to all activities that have a purposeful impact on people's physical and mental development. Education in the narrow sense specifically refers to school education, purposeful, planned, and systematic activities that affect people's physical and mental development.
Culture and society influence education. School subculture mainly includes two major categories, one is the educational content that educators choose deliberately, and it belongs to the formalized school subculture, The other is the social culture that exists in the school yet is not the educator's intentional pursuit, but it plays an educational influence which belongs to the informal school subculture. The development of culture makes the curriculum constantly enriched and updated, which is the most obvious aspect of the impact of culture on school education. The development of culture not only directly affects the quality and structure of educational content but also affects the methods, means and organizational forms of education. The deeper influence of the development of the means of conveying culture penetrated the school has caused the status and role of teachers in education to change. The deep-seated influence of culture infiltrating school education is the influence on the purpose of education (Allison-Burbank, 2016). For education, all cultural activities in society are mainly manifested in the following two aspects. Firstly, the development of social culture has increased people's demand for education and promoted the development and improvement of education. Education is always carried out under a certain social and cultural background, just like the principle of a rising tide, the improvement of the cultural level of the whole society will inevitably increase the demand for education. The second is that the development of social culture promotes the strengthening of the relationship between the school and the society. 
Just as culture and society are essential to education, education is also essential to culture and society. The first is that the continuation of culture only through materialized forms would not be working, and it is not enough. If there is no one who understands and knows how to use these material carriers, then these materials will become dead with neither the value of knowledge nor the value of use. Besides, culture also existing in the form of dematerialization, for example, it could exist in the form of psychology and behaviour. And the continuation of this part of the culture is inseparable from the cultivation of human beings. Therefore, education is a tool of creating and disseminating culture, which communicates the spiritual power of the human group and the spiritual power of everyone. Another effect of education on culture and society is popularization. Education is an important means to improve the cultural level of the entire nation and an important part of the cultural construction of a country. People often use the level of education in a country as a measure of the country’s cultural development. Education also has the role of communication and integration of different types of cultures. This role exists between different regions, countries and ethnic groups (Heaton, 2019). In the process of increasing tolerance for various cultures, school education is an indispensable driving factor.
To a certain extent, what people need to pay attention to is that the content of a certain society’s culture is always a reflection of a certain society’s politics and economy. The culture contains rich creations of human labour and wisdom, and it has a direct effect on the individual recipients. As the result, the interaction between education and culture is the point where education communicates with society and individuals and the transition of educational activities from macro to micro, and it is also the point where education communicates with different societies and the past and future of societies.
